# STRINGS
# For the majority of strings there is no need to add quotation marks.
# Nonetheless, if you want a number as string field or starting with it,
# don't forget to specify the quotes.
# For example: "1" (correct) instead of 1 (incorrect)

# FLOATING POINT NUMBERS
# If you want fields to be parsed as floats, always add the point sign.
# For example: 1.0 (parsed as f64) instead of 1 (parsed as i64)
